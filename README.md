## What this is

D.A.N.G.D.U.T. is a passive Wireless Intrusion Detection System (WIDS) designed to detect Wi-Fi deauthentication and disassociation attacks in real-time. It operates entirely passively—it does not transmit, inject, or control the Wi-Fi radio, ensuring it remains a pure monitoring tool.

Originally designed as an external module for the **Flipper Zero**, the project has now evolved to support standalone hardware, bringing the WIDS experience to dedicated pocket-sized devices with their own screens and interfaces.

### Supported Platforms:

1.  **M5 Cardputer ADV Stamp S3a** (Standalone)
    
2.  **ESP32-S3 Mini OLED** (Standalone)
    
3.  **Flipper Zero** (via ESP32-S2 WiFi Devboard)
    

## 1. M5 Cardputer & ESP32-S3 Mini OLED (Standalone Versions)

These versions are fully standalone and do not require a Flipper Zero to operate. They leverage the powerful ESP32-S3 chip to monitor attacks and render the UI directly on their built-in screens.

### 🌟 Exclusive Features

-   **Loading Boot:** Custom loading boot sequence for a smoother and visually appealing startup experience.
    
-   **Interactive Control (Cardputer):** Seamlessly start and stop the monitoring of Wi-Fi deauth attacks directly using the Cardputer's keyboard/interface.
    
-   **About the Author:** A dedicated section to view project and author information.
    
-   **Live Display:** Real-time attack alerts showing target MAC, sender MAC, and RSSI directly on the OLED/Cardputer screen.
    

### 🛠️ Installation

1.  Download the pre-compiled firmware for your specific device from the Releases/Assets section (e.g., `dangdut_esp32s3_cardputer.bin`).
    
2.  Connect your M5 Cardputer or ESP32-S3 Mini OLED to your computer via USB.
    
3.  Open the [**Dangdut Web Flasher**](https://dangdut-web-flasher.vercel.app/ "null") in your Chrome or Edge browser to flash the `.bin` file easily. _(Alternatively, you can use your preferred ESP32 flasher tool like `esptool.py` or M5Burner)._
    
4.  Reboot the device. You will see the new loading screen and can begin monitoring immediately.
    

## 2. Flipper Zero Version (.fap)

This version operates as a Flipper Zero application (`.fap`) that displays live attack detection status on the Flipper's screen by reading UART status lines sent from a connected DANGDUT WiFi Devboard (ESP32-S2).

### Folder Structure

```
dangdut_flipper_app/
  application.fam      - app manifest (name, entry point, category)
  dangdut_app.c        - main app source (UART read + screen rendering)
  images/              - icon assets folder (add dangdut.png, 10x10 px, 1-bit)
  README.md            - this file


```

### Requirements

-   Flipper Zero with official firmware (or compatible custom firmware supporting FAP external apps and `furi_hal_serial`).
    
-   `ufbt` (micro Flipper Build Tool) installed on your computer (`pip install ufbt`).
    
-   DANGDUT WiFi Devboard (ESP32-S2) flashed with `dangdut_esp32s2_flipper.ino`.
    

### Build & Install Steps

1.  Place this folder anywhere on your computer (e.g., `~/flipper-apps/dangdut_flipper_app/`).
    
2.  Open a terminal inside this folder and run: `ufbt`. This compiles `dangdut_app.c` into a `.fap` file under the `dist/` folder.
    
3.  Connect your Flipper Zero via USB, then run: `ufbt launch`. This installs and launches the app directly. _(Alternatively, copy the `.fap` to `SD Card / apps / Tools /` using qFlipper)._
    
4.  Plug in the flashed DANGDUT WiFi Devboard (ESP32-S2) into the Flipper Zero's GPIO header.
    
5.  Launch the app. You should see:
    
    -   `"Waiting for devboard..."` until the first UART line arrives.
        
    -   `"SYSTEM SECURE"` in normal state.
        
    -   `"ATTACK DETECTED"` (blinking red banner + red LED, plus MAC/RSSI info) during an attack.
        

### Controls

-   **BACK button** -> exit the app and return to the Flipper menu.
    

### Protocol Reference (ESP32-S2 to Flipper UART)

Must match the ESP32-S2 firmware output. Lines are newline-terminated, sent once per second at 115200 baud.
